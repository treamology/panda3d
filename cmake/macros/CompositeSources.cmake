# Filename: CompositeSources.cmake
# Description: This file defines the function composite_sources which looks at
#   a provided list of sources, generates _compositeN.cxx, and appends the
#   composites to the list. The original files in the list are marked as headers
#   so that they will be available in an IDE, but not compiled at build time.
#
# Usage:
#   composite_sources(target source_var)
#
# Example:
#   set(MY_SOURCES a.cxx b.cxx c.cxx)
#   composite_sources(my_lib MY_SOURCES)
#   add_library(my_lib ${MY_SOURCES})
#
# TODO: Only supports .cxx files so far, not yet .mm files
#   It should probably sort the files by extension (.c, .cxx, .mm) first.
#
